# Well-log-interpretation


## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate how quick and flexible the visualization of well-logs can be done using Python. The libraries used for this code are NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib.


## Data Source
The log dataset has been taken from Kaggle. The reference to the original dataset can be found here:

### Content
This is a well log file which contains approximately 8000 lines of data containing data of Resistivity, Spontaneous Potential, Gamma ray, Bulk density, Neutron and density porosity data. The data can be used to experiment and train small deep learning models, which can further be transferred to big datasets.


### Purpose
The use of this open-source code is _free_ for any academic purpose with appropriate citation of the repository and author. Feel free to fork the repository and make edits as per your own requirement.


### Acknowledgements
A very thank to KGS (Kansas Geological Survey) to provide such a huge dataset for public use!
